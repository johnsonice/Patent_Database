      Methods for carrying out high temperature reactions such as biomass pyrolysis or gasification using solar energy. The biomass particles are rapidly heated in a solar thermal entrainment reactor. The residence time of the particles in the reactor can be 5 seconds or less. The biomass particles may be directly or indirectly heated depending on the reactor design. Metal oxide particles can be fed into the reactor concurrently with the biomass particles, allowing carbothermic reduction of the metal oxide particles by biomass pyrolysis products. The reduced metal oxide particles can be reacted with steam to produce hydrogen in a subsequent process step.

      As processes, biomass gasification and pyrolysis have been known for a long time. Several different types of reactors have been used to gasify and/or pyrolize biomass including fixed bed reactors, fluidized bed reactors, and entrained flow reactors. A variety of sources of heat for biomass gasification and pyrolysis processes have been used, including fossil fuels (Ni, et al, Fuel Processing Technology, 2006, pp. 461-472) and combustion of biomass or biomass reaction products such as pyrolysis oil (e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 4,497,637 to Purdy et al).

      Solar gasification of carbonaceous particles has also been reported in the patent literature. U.S. Pat. No. 5,647,877 to Epstein reports solar energy gasification of solid carbonaceous material in a liquid dispersion. An aqueous dispersion of carbonaceous material is introduced into the reactor so as to form water droplets enclosing particulates of the carbonaceous material. The solid carbonaceous material is heated by solar energy and transfers heat to a surrounding liquid. Hydrogen is produced in the process by the decomposition/gasification of the hydrocarbon (coal) particles. A variety of carbonaceous materials are mentioned as possible feedstocks including coal and various biomasses.

      It has been shown that solar thermal reactors can achieve temperatures up to 2500 K (2227° C.). Temperatures even higher than this are achievable, but in those regimes materials and reradiation loss issues become major concerns. Solar thermal systems have been applied to the dissociation of methane (Dahl, et al., International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, 29, 2004) or ZnO (Perkins, et al., International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, 29, 2004; Steinfeld, Solar Energy, 78, 2005). Carbon has been used as reducing agents for ZnO (Müller, R, P Haeberling, and R Palumbo, “Further advances toward the development of a direct heating solar thermal chemical reactor for the thermal dissociation of ZnO(s),” Solar Energy, 80, 2005, pp. 500-511).

      BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
     </heading>
     <p id="p-0010" num="0009">
      The invention provides processes that perform biomass gasification or pyrolysis for production of hydrogen, synthesis gas, liquid fuels, or other hydrocarbon based chemicals. The methods of the invention use solar thermal energy as the energy source for the biomass pyrolysis or gasification. This allows operation at temperatures above 950° C., speeding up reaction kinetics and shifting thermodynamics to various reaction end products, thus, bypassing the formation of tars and other liquids that have a tendency to cause plugging or increased pressure drop in gas/solid filtration devices downstream of the reactor and which are undesired side products. The increase in reaction rate, the use of a renewable energy resource, the avoidance of tars, and the wider range of available thermodynamic regimes give great advantage to one who would utilize solar thermal energy. Usage of solar thermal energy can reduce the overall amount of biomass required to produce the product chemicals, allows for a greater range of product control, does not rely on fossil fuel usage, and takes advantage of a freely available resource (solar energy).
     </p>
     <p id="p-0011" num="0010">
      In the methods of the invention, an entrainment flow solar-thermal reactor is used to carry out the high temperature thermal dissociation reactions, thereby permitting rapid-heating of the biomass particles and short residence times of the particles in the reactor. Rapid heating is of great advantage for this solar chemistry. Rapidly heating to high temperature (&gt;950° C.) prevents the biomass particles from spending significant portions of time in temperature regimes (200° C.-800° C.) where formation of liquid side products and tars is favorable. The selectivity of the reactor toward desired products is thus increased. Likewise, rapid heating allows the particles to spend the most time possible in the temperature regimes where reaction rates are fastest (950° C. to 1400° C.). A rapid reaction allows the thermal energy imparted to the particles to be converted to chemical energy more quickly, reducing the portion of incident energy lost to re-radiation or conduction and increasing reactor efficiency. Additionally, a more rapid reaction leads to shorter effective residence times and higher reactor throughput; essentially, the production rates of fuels can be increased while leaving the area of solar concentrators constant. In different embodiments, the residence time is less than or equal to 5 seconds or less than or equal to 3 seconds. In an embodiment, the heating rate of the particles is greater than 100° C./s; preferably, this heating rate is greater than 1000° C./s.

      The present invention also provides a method for carrying out a closed thermochemical/photosynthetic cycle for splitting water to produce hydrogen. A biomass feedstock such as algae can be grown in a controlled atmosphere greenhouse environment with algae receiving direct sunlight and being fed water and carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen to the environment via photosynthesis. The algae can be cultivated and fed as a biomass reactant to the reactor described herein. The algae can be pyrolyzed by high temperature solar thermal heating as described herein. The resulting “syngas” of carbon monoxide and hydrogen can be fed to a conventional “water-gas shift reactor” where water is fed and hydrogen and carbon dioxide are produced via a controlled catalytic process (CO+H

      The present invention also provides processes which involve reduction of metal oxide particles with biomass pyrolysis products in a solar-thermal reactor. The invention also provides “renewable” hydrogen producing processes in which the hydrogen produced from reaction of the reduced metal oxide products with water is combined with hydrogen produced by reaction of gaseous products of the solar thermal reactor in a water-gas shift reactor, both processes being as described in Example 6 and elsewhere in this application. The invention also provides processes in which hydrogen produced by the methods of the invention are combined with conventional fossil feeds. For example, hydrogen can be combined with coal to produce methane as described in Example 7. Such a process represents a transitional bridge to a truly hydrogen economy.

      DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
     </heading>
     <p id="p-0028" num="0027">
      In the processes of the invention, a solid or liquid biomass feed is pyrolyzed or gasified in a solar thermal reactor system at elevated temperatures. In different embodiments of the pyrolyzation processes of the invention, no significant source of oxygen or water is supplied during the process. An oxidizing agent is conventionally present in gasification processes. In the gasification processes of the invention, water (generally in the form of steam) is supplied and contacted with the biomass particles.
     </p>
     <p id="p-0029" num="0028">
      In an embodiment, the biomass feed is in the form of solid particles. The biomass feed particles or droplets are entrained in a gas as they move through the reactor. In an embodiment, metal oxide particles are fed into the reactor concurrently with biomass particles. In another embodiment particles of a fossil fuel such as coal are fed into the reactor concurrently with biomass particles. In an embodiment, no additional catalyst is added to the biomass feed.
     </p>
     <p id="p-0030" num="0029">
      The necessary endothermic heat of reaction and sensible heat is supplied by a solar-thermal energy system. The biomass particles or droplets may be directly heated by solar radiation, in which case the reactor is configured to transmit solar radiation to the particles. In another embodiment, the biomass particles or droplets are indirectly heated. As used herein, “indirect” heating means that the heating is by radiation from a heated wall that is itself heated indirectly or directly by solar radiation.
     </p>
     <p id="p-0031" num="0030">
      In an embodiment, the pyrolysis and gasification processes of the invention produce hydrogen and carbon monoxide (synthesis gas or syngas). Other products such as carbon dioxide, carbon, methane and higher molecular weight hydrocarbons may also be produced in the process. In different embodiments, the conversion of the non-ash components of the biomass is greater 30%, greater than or equal to 40%, greater than 50%, greater than or equal to 60%, greater than or equal to 70%, greater than or equal to 75% greater than 80%, greater than 90% or greater than 95%. This extent of conversion may be achieved in a single pass. In different embodiments, the conversion of carbon to carbon monoxide is greater than 30%, greater than 40%, greater than 50%, greater than 60%, greater than 70%, greater than 80%, greater than 90% or greater than 95%. In different embodiments, the molar ratio of carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide is less than 25% or less than 10%. In different embodiments, the molar ratio of hydrogen (H
      <sub>
       2
      </sub>
      ) to carbon monoxide is 1:1, greater than 1:1 and less than 2:1; less than 2:1; greater than 2:1 and less than 3:1; or greater than 3:1. The ratio of hydrogen to carbon monoxide may be adjusted by adjusting the amount of water added to the feed.
     </p>
     <p id="p-0032" num="0031">
      The products of the biomass pyrolyzation or gasification process can be combined in a Fischer-Tropsch reactor to produce liquid hydrocarbon products, or can be reacted further with water in a Water-Gas Shift reaction to maximize hydrogen yield. Such a process makes use of renewable, biologically derived feedstocks and is, in a worst case, carbon and greenhouse gas neutral.
     </p>
     <p id="p-0033" num="0032">
      As stated above, the invention provides a chemical process in which carbon containing biomass feedstocks (for example, but not limited to, cellulose, hemi-cellulose, lignin, xylose, other plant sugars, algae, agricultural, industrial, brewery, or forestry residues) are either pyrolized or combined with water at high temperature (&gt;950° C.). In different embodiments, the biomass feedstock may be a tall prairie grass, such as switch-grass and/or miscanthus, algae, pressed algal residue from a biodiesal processing facility, spent grain from a brewery, wood chips, or sawdust. In an embodiment, feedstocks for use with the invention do not include mixtures of coal and biomass. In another embodiment particles of a fossil fuel such as coal are fed into the reactor concurrently with biomass particles. In one aspect of the invention, the biomass feedstock is selected to have an ash content less than about 15%, less than about 10% or less than about 5%.
     </p>
     <p id="p-0034" num="0033">
      In different embodiments, the maximum particle size of the biomass feedstock is less than 10 mm, less than 5 mm, less than 1 mm, less than 500 microns, less than 200 microns, less than 100 microns, less than 50 microns, or less than 20 microns. In an embodiment, the minimum “average” size of the biomass feedstock is 10 microns, as identified by the volume average equivalent spherical particle diameter or as the volume average of the longest particle dimension (if the particles are long and flat, like blades of grass). There may be smaller particles in the system (e.g. submicron), but on a mass basis these particles will be a very small fraction (in an embodiment &lt;5 vol %) of the total.
     </p>
     <p id="p-0035" num="0034">
      The reactor product composition can be thermodynamically and kinetically controlled by reactor temperature, pressure, residence time, water concentration, feedstock concentration, and inert gas concentration, in addition to reactor design, solar energy concentration, and other factors not mentioned here. In different embodiments, the temperature in the hot zone of the reactor is between 750° C. and 1500° C., between 950° C. and 1400° C., or between 1100° C. and 1350° C., where the temperature is the average temperature of the particles in the reaction hot zone. The necessary energy to attain such temperatures and achieve the reaction is, in all cases, derived from a system which converts solar radiation into thermal energy (“solar-thermal”).
     </p>
     <p id="p-0036" num="0035">
      In an embodiment, the reactor operates at atmospheric pressure. In another embodiment, the reactor can be run at pressures above atmospheric pressure, but this will drive the thermodynamics toward the liquid products and the reactants. In this embodiment, the compressors can be removed from the downstream side of the reactor and replaced with water pumps.
     </p>
     <p id="p-0037" num="0036">
      During the biomass gasification processes of the invention, the water concentration provides at least a one to one molar ratio of steam to biomass feed. In an embodiment, the water concentration may be increased slightly to compensate for a relatively high carbon to oxygen atomic ratio in the feedstock.
     </p>
     <p id="p-0038" num="0037">
      In an embodiment, the invention provides a method for at least partially converting biomass particles to hydrogen and carbon monoxide, the method comprising the steps of:
     </p>
     <p id="p-0039" num="0038">
      a) providing a solar-thermal reactor comprising an outer protection shell and an inner reaction shell having an inlet and an outlet, the outer protection shell being at least partially transparent or having an opening to the atmosphere for transmission of solar energy,

     <p id="p-0040" num="0039">
      b) flowing a gas stream comprising entrained biomass particles from the inlet to the outlet of the reaction shell; and

     <p id="p-0041" num="0040">
      c) heating the biomass particles in the reactor at least in part with a source of concentrated sunlight through solar thermal heating to a temperature at which the biomass particles react to form products comprising hydrogen and carbon monoxide.

      The invention also provides methods for at least partially converting the biomass particles to other products in addition to hydrogen and carbon monoxide. These other products include, but are not limited to, carbon and carbon dioxide. In an embodiment, the biomass particles are at least partially converted to carbon, hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide.

A “fluid wall” gas is flowed radically inward into the reaction shell through the porous section of the shell, thus providing a blanket of gas. The “fluid wall” can prevent deposition of particles on the inside wall and protect the inside wall from the reaction products. As used herein, a “porous” shell region permits gas flow through the walls of the region while a “nonporous” shell region does not. In one embodiment, a gas stream of “fluid-wall” gas flows in the annular region between the outer “protection” shell and the inner “reaction” shell. The “fluid-wall” gas enters the plenum between the inner and outer shell through an inlet and exits the plenum through an outlet. The porous section of the inner shell forms one outlet of the plenum.

The “fluid-wall” gas enters the plenum through an inlet and exits the plenum through an outlet. One outlet of the first plenum is the porous section of the inner shell.

   In an embodiment, of the metal oxide reduction process, concentrated solar-thermal radiation passes through the outer “protection” shell and directly heats the inner “reaction” shell. The inner “reaction” shell conducts heat and re-radiates from the inner wall and heats the biomass and metal oxide particles and gas stream flowing through it. Other reactor designs described elsewhere in this application can also be used. When heated, the biomass particles undergo a pyrolysis reaction. Products of the pyrolysis reaction include hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and carbon. At elevated temperatures, metal oxide particles can react with hydrogen, carbon monoxide or carbon to form a reduced metal oxide product. Depending on the reactor temperature, the metal oxide particles may react with more than one of the biomass pyrolysis reaction products.

Reaction and separation steps following the metal oxide reduction step may be performed “off-sun”, allowing continuous production of hydrogen from stored reduced metal oxide product.

   , the outer shell of the reactor may essentially form a cavity which is largely non-transparent to solar radiation but contains an opening or transparent window to admit solar radiation into the interior. In an embodiment, reflection or absorption and re-radiation occurs at the inner surface of the outer shell. In an embodiment, the inner surface of the outer shell may reflect solar and/or infrared radiation. In an embodiment, the inner surface of the outer shell reflects both solar and infrared radiation. In an embodiment, the inner wall of the outer protection shell is reflective or absorbing or re-emitting with respect to radiation in the wavelength range 200 nm to 20 micrometers. General designs for these types of cavities are known to those skilled in the art. In an embodiment, the inner wall of the outer protection shell comprises a reflective coating such as a gold, silver, or aluminum coating. The reflective coating can reflect incident solar energy and infrared (IR) radiation emitted from the inner shells. The reflective coating may be protected from oxidation by coating it with a thin layer of silica.
  </p>
  <p id="p-0058" num="0060">
   In an embodiment, the outer shell may be made of a plurality of layers in close proximity to one another. For example, the outer shell may have three layers. A three-layer outer shell may have an outer layer made of a metal (e.g. steel or an aluminum alloy), a middle layer made of a thermally insulating material (e.g. a refractory material such as alumina), and an inner layer which may be either absorbing or reflective. An absorbing inner layer may be made of a material having relatively low thermal conductivity and capable of withstanding high temperatures (e.g. zirconia, hafnia, alumina). In an embodiment, the absorbing inner layer is constructed of ytrria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) which heats upon contact with solar energy and re-radiates to the reactor tubes. A reflecting inner layer may be made of a metal such as steel and coated with a gold or silver film; in such case a cooling mechanism may be provided in the middle layer to prevent melting of the reflective material. A reflecting inner layer may also be made of polished aluminum. In an embodiment, the outer shell contains a transparent window. Such a window may be a rectangular vertical quartz window (with the long axis of the rectangle aligned perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the reactor).

  <p id="p-0059" num="0061">
   In an embodiment, the outer shell effectively comprises two layers, an outer layer and an inner reflecting or absorbing layer. In an embodiment, the outer layer is made of quartz and the inner layer is a coating of a reflective material such as silver or gold. The coating is applied to the sections of the internal wall of the shell where sunlight is not being concentrated and entering the vessel in order to keep the concentrated sunlight inside the reactor. If such a reflective coating is used, there must be an uncoated transparent section, window or opening to allow the concentrated sunlight into the vessel. The shell wall transparent area, allowing for concentrated sunlight entry and subsequent solar thermal heating, should be selected to provide heating during the desired reaction residence time requirements for the process. If the temperatures at the outer shell wall exceed the melting temperature of the reflective coating, cooling is provided to prevent melting of the reflective coating.

   In another embodiment, the outer shell may be formed of a single layer of material. In this embodiment, the shell is of a material which is either transparent or contains a hole or window which admits solar radiation to the interior.
  </p>
  <p id="p-0061" num="0063">
   Suitable transparent materials for the outer shell include oxidation resistant materials such as quartz. The “protection” shell may also be made of a metal with a sufficiently high melting point, such as stainless steel. The metal “protection shell” may have a transparent window which allows concentrated sunlight to directly heat the “heating” shell. At least part of the non-transparent part of the “protection” shell can be surrounded by heat transfer fluid contained by a jacket to provide cooling of the outer metal refractory “protection” shell, particularly in the region immediately surrounding the window. The heat transfer fluid can be water or a molten salt such as a mixture of sodium and potassium nitrates. Molten salts are capable of operating at temperatures up to about 500° C. Use of such a cooling jacket can allow for significantly improved efficiency.

  <p id="p-0062" num="0064">
   In an embodiment, the “reaction” or “heating” shell may be surrounded by refractory insulation in the region where it is not directly exposed to concentrated sunlight via the transparent section. The insulation may be concentrically placed and extends substantially from the “reaction” or “heating” shell to the concentric “protection” shell, although it may not completely fill the space between the heating shell and the protection shell. The refractory insulation can be a combination of graphite insulation near the “heating” shell and an alumina type refractory insulation near the “protection” shell. This design arrangement allows concentrated sunlight to enter through a transparent section and heat the “reaction” or “heating” shell while the surrounding insulation reduces conductive and convective losses of energy from the “reaction” or “heating” shell, thereby increasing the efficiency of the process.

   The innermost reaction shell has an inlet and an outlet for the entraining gas stream. The inlet end of the inner shell is the upstream end of the shell, while the outlet end is the downstream end. The interior of the innermost shell defines a reaction chamber within which the high temperature reaction takes place. The innermost shell is capable of emitting sufficient radiant energy to raise the temperature of the reactants within the reaction chamber to a level required to initiate and sustain the desired chemical reaction. The innermost shell is made of a high temperature refractory material. When the particles are indirectly heated, the refractory material subsequently heats flowing biomass particles flowing through the first inner shell.

   In an embodiment, the refractory material is substantially chemically unreactive with the particles or the reactant or product gases. In an embodiment, the innermost shell is graphite. In other embodiments, the innermost shell is silicon carbide or a refractory metal or alloy capable of withstanding the temperature required for a given decomposition reaction. Other suitable high temperature ceramics include ytrria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ), silicon nitride, hafnium boride, hafnium carbide, silicon carbide-silicon carbide composites, boron nitride or alumina (aluminum oxide). Refractory metal alloys suitable for temperatures below about 1200° C. include, but are not limited to, high temperature superalloys, including nickel-based superalloys such as Inconel® or Haynes® 214. In another embodiment, the innermost shell may be made of quartz. In an embodiment, the reaction shell is made of silicon carbide, Inconel, quartz, silicon nitride, or alumina.

   The inner reaction shell may be made of a nonporous material. In another embodiment, the innermost shell is at least partially porous. The innermost shell may be wholly of porous material or may comprise one or more regions of porous material. The porous region(s) of the innermost shell are selected so that sufficient uniform flow of gas occurs radially inward through the pores to provide a fluid-wall protective blanket for the radially inward surface of the innermost shell. The porosity of the porous region(s) can be varied and is selected on the basis of the required gas flow and allowable pressure drop to provide for a fluid-wall of gas. The length of the porous section(s) of the “reaction” shell can be varied and is determined by the zone where oxidation of the “reaction” shell or particle deposition is most likely to occur. The placement of the porous section along the length of the “reaction” shell is determined by the same considerations. In an embodiment, the length of the porous section of the “reaction” shell is limited to where it is needed. The entry of fluid-wall gas into the “reaction” shell increases the overall volumetric flow rate of gases through the “reaction” shell, thus reducing residence time and limiting the production throughput of the reactor. In an embodiment, the porosity in a given porous region is substantially uniform. A partially porous reaction tube may be made by joining together a porous tube and a solid tube. Graphite tubes may be joined by high temperature sintering using a carbon-containing paste. Silicon carbide tubes may also be joined by sintering with the appropriate sintering aid. Metal or alloy tubes may be welded or brazed, including porous metal or alloy sections. In different embodiments, the ratio of the length of the reaction shell to the inner diameter of the reaction shell is from 2 to 12, from 2 to 4, from 4 to 6, from 6 to 12, between 5 and 30, between 5 and 10, and between 20 and 25.

   When a plurality of reaction shells are present in the reactor, the reaction shells may have the same inner diameter or may have different inner diameters. In an embodiment, the inner shells have different inner diameters and smallest inner shell has an inner diameter one third the inner diameter of the largest inner shell. In this embodiment, the larger inner shells may be located closer to the center of the outer shell then the smaller inner shells.

   If used, the second inner shell is typically composed of nonporous high temperature refractory material. In an embodiment, the second inner shell is made of solid graphite. As previously discussed, the second inner shell can function as a “heating” shell, since it radiates heat to the innermost shell. In addition, the combination of the first and the second inner shell can at least partially define a plenum or volume for the fluid-wall gas. Depending on the material of the second inner shell, a non-oxidizing and non-dissociating “purge” gas may be flowed in a second plenum substantially located between the outer shell and the second inner shell to protect the second inner “heating” shell from oxidation. The purge gas may be argon, helium, neon, nitrogen, or any other chemically inert gas.

   In general, the shells comprising the reactors of the invention may be positioned vertically or horizontally, or in any other spatial orientation. For the case of a vertical reaction shell process, the apparatus may be arranged to provide upward or downward flow of the gas stream and the cloud of particles. Upward flow guarantees that aggregated particles will not be carried through the reaction shell. Downward flow reduces the potential for plugging in the solids feed line. Preferably, the reactor shell is positioned vertically and flow is downward.
  </p>
  <p id="p-0069" num="0071">
   Each of the shells is characterized by a longitudinal axis (vertical centerline). In the plane created by cross-sectioning the reactor transverse to the longitudinal axis of the outer shell so that the plane passes through the outer shell window or aperture, a first horizontal dividing line (this line can also be termed the horizontal centerline) can be defined which passes through the center of the outer shell and the window or aperture, dividing the outer shell and the window or aperture into two equal or nearly equal halves. This horizontal centerline can be said to establish right and left portions inside the outer shell. A second horizontal dividing line can be established in the same plane which passes through the center of the outer shell, is orthogonal to the horizontal centerline, and establishes front and back portions inside the outer shell, with the front portion being the portion nearest the aperture or window.
  </p>
  <p id="p-0070" num="0072">
   To describe positions of the inner shells within the outer shell in a horizontal cross-section of the outer shell, an x,y coordinate system can be defined whose origin is at the center of the outer shell and in which the y axis of the coordinate system is aligned with the horizontal centerline as defined above and the x axis of the coordinate system is aligned with the second horizontal dividing line as defined above.
  </p>
  <p id="p-0071" num="0073">
   Locations of the inner shells can also be specified by their distance from particular locations with respect to the outer shell. For example, the location of the center of an inner shell can be specified by its distance from the intersection of the horizontal centerline with the inner surface of the outer shell at the “back” portion of this inner surface, opposite the aperture or window. Locations may also be determined with respect to the center of the outer shell.
  </p>
  <p id="p-0072" num="0074">
   Locations of the inner shell can also be specified by their orientation with respect to the average direction of the solar radiation entering the solar reactor. In an embodiment, the average direction of the solar radiation is generally aligned with the horizontal centerline.

  <p id="p-0073" num="0075">
   If the center of a first inner shell is “farther back” in the outer shell than the center of a second inner shell, the y component of the distance between the center of the first inner shell and the intersection of the horizontal centerline with the “back portion” of inner surface of the outer shell is smaller than the y component of the distance between the center of the second inner shell and the intersection of the horizontal center line with this back portion of the inner surface of the outer shell.

   In an embodiment, the centers of the inner shells lie along a circular arc, with the ends of the arc being established (anchored) by the positions of the center of the inner shells closest to the outer shell. The arc is bisected by the horizontal centerline. In an embodiment, the circular arc is a semicircle.

   In another embodiment, the inner shells are arranged in a staggered pattern. In an embodiment, the inner shells can be grouped into a plurality of rows, each row being generally perpendicular to the horizontal centerline but having a different depth within the outer shell (different y coordinate). The rows may form a straight line or they may be somewhat curved. In an embodiment, the rows form a straight line parallel to the x axis. The centers of the shells in each row are positioned so that they do not “line up” with (do not have the same x coordinate as) shells in adjacent rows. Each row has at least one shell, and may have a plurality of shells. In an embodiment, the pattern is generally symmetric about the horizontal centerline. The pattern can also be viewed in terms of the geometric properties of lines drawn between the centers of neighboring inner tubes. For example, the angle made between a line drawn between the center point of a first inner tube in a “front” row and the center point of a second neighboring tube in the row behind the “front” row and the line drawn between the center point of the second tube and the center point of a third inner tube located in the “front” row (which is a neighbor to both the first and second tube) can be from 40 degrees to 140 degrees or from 60 degrees to 130 degrees. The specific arrangement is chosen so as to maximize interception of incident radiation.

   In the entrained flow reactors used in the practice of the invention, the biomass particles or droplets are entrained in the carrier gas and are generally transported along the longitudinal axis of the reaction tube (or tubes). The biomass particles or droplets are dispersed in the reactor apparatus, and the form of dispersion is important. Preferably, the particles or droplets flow as a dust or particle cloud through the apparatus, dispersed in a dispersing process gas. Preferably, the particles are non-agglomerated. In an embodiment, the biomass is in the form of solid particles. In an embodiment, the solid biomass particles are not enclosed in water droplets. Several different methods can be used to disperse solid particles. In an embodiment, the particles are entrained by a fluidized bed feeder. The particles can also be dispersed mechanically, such as by shearing on the surface of a rotating drum or brush. Alternatively, the particles can be dispersed using the shear provided by high velocity gas exiting with the particles from a feed injection tube. Experience has shown that the exiting “tip speed” from the injection tube should be at least 10 m/s to provide the shear necessary for complete dispersion of fine powders. In other embodiments, the biomass feedstock may also be a liquid and atomized into the aerosol stream or a solid mixed with liquid to create a slurry which is then introduced into the reactor.
  </p>
  <p id="p-0084" num="0086">
   The initial composition of the gas used to entrain the biomass particles or droplets may be an inert gas, steam, a recycled or compatible reaction product gas such as hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, or a mixture thereof. In an embodiment, the entraining gas is a mixture of inert gas and steam. Suitable inert gases include, but are not limited to nitrogen, argon, helium, or neon. In an embodiment, the initial composition of the entraining gas does not contain substantial amounts of molecular oxygen or air. The composition of the entraining gas may also vary along the reactor. For example, the entraining gas may be provided as an inert gas at the reactor inlet and become a mixture of inert gas and gaseous reaction products downstream of the reactor inlet. Steam can be introduced after the particles are entrained in a gas mixture, but prior to introduction of the entrained particles into the reactor. Steam can also be fed through a steam micronizer as jets of steam, located at the feed inlet of the reactor. In this case, jets of steam impinge on biomass being fed and provide a means to reduce the particle size of the biomass feed in-situ at the entrance of the reactor. The entraining gas stream is selected so that it is compatible with the biomass particle pyrolysis or gasification process and the “reaction” wall of the solar-thermal fluid-wall reactor. The gas stream can be preheated to reduce the requirements of the solar thermal field and increase efficiency by passing it through a heat exchanger, removing heat from the products of the solar thermal reactor. Additionally, heat could be removed from an exothermic downstream fuel processing unit (Fischer-Tropsch reactor, water gas shift reactor, or combustion turbine).

   In the methods of the invention, biomass particles are heated at least in part with a source of concentrated sunlight. The source of concentrated sunlight may be a solar concentrator.

   The temperature inside the innermost shell of the reactor can be measured with a thermocouple. Alternatively, temperatures inside the reactor can be measured with an optical pyrometer. For a three-shell reactor, the hot zone temperature measured with an optical pyrometer is typically the temperature of the nonporous “heating” shell, since the “heating” shell encloses the “reaction” shell in the hot zone. The temperature inside the inner “reaction” shell may be less than that of the “heating” shell due to thermal losses due to heating the porous shell and the gases in the first plenum and the reaction shell.

   The sunlight can be provided in the form of a collimated beam (spot) source, a concentric annular source distributed circumferentially around the reactor, or in the form of a linearized slot source providing heating axially along the length of reactor. The light can be redirected and focused or defocused with various optical components to provide the concentration on or in the reactor as required. In an embodiment, the concentrated solar radiation is further concentrated by a secondary concentrating reflector before entering the reactor. An example of a suitable solar concentrator for use in the present invention is the High-Flux Solar Furnace (HFSF) at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in Golden, Colo. The HFSF uses a series of mirrors that concentrate sunlight to an intensified focused beam at power levels of 10 kW into an approximate diameter of 10 cm. The HFSF is described in Lewandowski, Bingham, O'Gallagher, Winston and Sagie, “Performance characterization of the SERI Hi-Flux Solar Furnace,” Solar Energy Materials 24 (1991), 550-563. The furnace design is described starting at page 551, wherein it is stated,

     <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0090">
      The performance objectives set for the HFSF resulted in a unique design. To enable support of varied research objectives, designers made the HFSF capable of achieving extremely high flux concentrations in a two-stage configuration and of generating a wide range of flux concentrations. A stationary focal point was mandatory because of the nature of many anticipated experiments. It was also desirable to move the focal point off axis. An off-axis system would allow for considerable flexibility in size and bulk of experiments and would eliminate blockage and consequent reduction in power.
     </li>
     <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0091">
      In particular, achieving high flux concentration in a two-stage configuration (an imaging primary in conjunction with a nonimaging secondary concentrator) dictates a longer f/D [ratio of focal length to diameter] for the primary [concentrator] than for typical single-stage furnaces. Typical dish concentrators used in almost all existing solar furnaces are about f/D=0.6. To effectively achieve high flux concentration, a two-stage system must have an f/D=2. Values higher than this will not achieve significantly higher concentration due to increased losses in the secondary concentrator. Values lower than this will result in a reduction of maximum achievable two-stage flux. At low values of f/D, the single stage peak flux can be quite high, but the flux profiles are also very peaked and the average flux is relatively low. With a longer f/D, two-stage system, the average flux can be considerably higher than in any single-stage system. The final design of the HFSF has an effective f/D of 1.85. At this f/D, it was also possible to move the focal point considerably off axis (˜30°) with very little degradation in system performance. This was because of the longer f/D and partly because of the multi-faceted design of the primary concentrator. This off-axis angle allows the focal point and a large area around it to be completely removed from the beam between the heliostat and the primary concentrator.

   When the outer shell is wholly transparent or has a window which extends completely around the shell, the concentrated sunlight is preferably distributed circumferentially around the reactor using at least one secondary concentrator. Depending upon the length of the reaction shell, multiple secondary concentrators may be stacked along the entire length of the reaction shell. For the HFSF described above, a secondary concentrator that is capable of delivering 7.4 kW of the 10 kW available (74% efficiency) circumferentially around a 2.54 cm diameter×9.4 cm long reaction tube has been designed, constructed, and interfaced to the reactor.

   As used herein, the “residence time” is the time that the biomass particles spend in the hot zone of the innermost “reaction” shell. The hot zone length may be estimated as the length of the reactor directly irradiated by the source of concentrated sunlight. The residence time depends on the reactor dimensions, such as the hot zone length and the inner diameter of the “reaction” shell. The residence time also depends on the flow rate of the entraining gas stream containing the biomass particles and the flow rate of any fluid-wall gas through the pores of the inner shell. In addition, the residence time may vary across the diameter of the reaction shell, in which case a mean residence time may be calculated. The residence time may be calculated through modeling or estimated from ideal gas considerations. In different embodiments, the residence time is less than or equal to 10 seconds, less than or equal to 5 seconds, or less than or equal to 3 seconds. The biomass may or may not be completely reacted before it leaves the hot zone.

The fluid-wall gas used in the solar-thermal reactor is also selected so that it is compatible with the “reaction” shell. The gas stream used to provide the “fluid-wall” blanket gas flowing inward from the porous “reaction” shell wall is also preferably not a dissociating gas whose dissociation products would plug the pores of the porous wall.

LECO C200 analysis of this powder showed it to be &gt;96% carbon for each of the high temperature points, and a lower &gt;75% carbon for the low temperature experiments. This is likely due to unreacted lignin in products. Conversion to CO was higher at higher temperatures, being between 40% and 45%. These are right around the theoretical maximum, although some adsorbed water on the feed material could push the theoretical conversion higher due to gasification. The conversion was lower at 1200 K, at 16% and 18% for the low and high residence time points, respectively. In all of the experiments, the ratio of CO to CO

The correlation between partial pressure and concentration for each species differ, so a relatively larger increase in the partial pressure of one species does not necessarily mean a larger increase in the molar flow rate of that species.
