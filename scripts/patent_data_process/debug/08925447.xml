      BACKGROUND
     </heading>
     <p id="p-0004" num="0003">
      In the food industry, particularly in relation to commercially prepackaged and prepared foods or restaurants, businesses are turning to faster methods of cooking food in a uniform manner. In addition, such businesses are seeking to streamline operations including cleanup operations and are seeking to reduce the risk of employee injury.
     </p>
     <p id="p-0005" num="0004">
      In an example, commercially prepackaged food products or commercially precooked foods can be cooked on a cooking belt. In another example, meat can be cooked on a flat surface (i.e., standard stove configuration) with heat only from below. Non-stick cooking surfaces can prevent sticking of the food product to the cooking surface. Reduced sticking results in reduced effort used to remove the cooked food product from the surface. The reduced sticking also reduces burnt residue that is to be scraped off the cooking surface so that subsequent food products to be cooked do not stick. However, continued use and wear of the non-stick surface can diminish the non-stick properties. As such, further improvements to non-stick cooking surfaces are desired.

      DETAILED DESCRIPTION
     </heading>
     <p id="p-0017" num="0016">
      Grilling or cooking belts are often used for the production of commercially precooked and prepackaged food. The cooking belts can be used in a continuous process for the preparation of the food, significantly increasing productivity over a static surface, such as a grill. However, the continuous movement of the belt can result in stresses to the components, leading to wear and eventually to replacing the belt. Cooking belts extend to lengths up to hundreds of feet and replacement of such belts can be complicated and time consuming, thus causing significant production delays.
     </p>
     <p id="p-0018" num="0017">
      Generally, the belts are replaced when the ability of the cooking surface to release the food product is reduced. The failure of the cooking surface is often the result of the formation of splits in the surface. The splits can expose underlying components of the cooking belt, such as a reinforcement material that may not have the same release properties as the overlying non-stick surface. Additionally, the splits can trap liquids or greases, and provide a path for the liquid or grease to reach the fibers of the reinforcement material. Once liquid or grease has penetrated the reinforcement material, residues from the liquid or grease can abrade the reinforcement material during further use, reducing the mechanical properties of the belt, leading to potential breakage of the belt.
     </p>
     <p id="p-0019" num="0018">
      Applicants discovered that in particular instances splits, which tend to extend along either fill or warp direction, depending on the style of greige good, can form on the points of overlap of the fill and warp yarns. The splits can form due to the shearing stress, such as from the movement of the belt around rollers. If allowed to propagate, such splits can permit grease and other liquids to infuse into fibrous supports, leading to embrittled belts with reduced strength and stress resistance.
     </p>
     <p id="p-0020" num="0019">
      In a particular embodiment, a sheet material includes a low surface energy polymer, such as a fluoropolymer. Such a sheet material can be in the form of a grill sheet, a cooking belt, a film, a coating, or a combination thereof. In an embodiment, a sheet material particularly suitable as a cooking belt includes a reinforcement material and a fluoropolymer film overlying the reinforcement material. In an example, the fluoropolymer film is an extruded fluoropolymer film, such as an expanded fluoropolymer film. Optionally, a skived or cast fluoropolymer film can be placed to overlie the extruded fluoropolymer film. Such an embodiment can prevent split propagation, leading to improved mechanical properties and belt life.

      are not perpendicular to the warp yarns. For example, the fill yarns
      <b>
       212

       204
      </b>
      can be left biased (the smallest angle formed between the warp and fill yarns) is on the left side relative to the warp direction) or right biased (the smallest angle is on the right side relative to the warp direction). In an example, the fabric layer
      <b>
       214
      </b>
      can include fill yarns that are askew. In particular, the fabric layer
      <b>

      can include fill yarns that askew in a manner opposite that of the fabric layer
      <b>
       204
      </b>
      . For example, the fabric layer
      <b>
       204
      </b>
      can be left side biased and the fabric layer
      <b>
       214
      </b>
      can be right side biased or visa-versa.

     <p id="p-0031" num="0030">
      In an example, more than one fabric layers having different fill yarn orientations can be coupled to form the reinforcement layer. For example, fabric layers

      and
      <b>
       204

      can be bonded together, such as by laminating, with or without an adhesive, or an autogenous bonding process. In an example, each fabric layer can be coated with a fluoropolymer coating. In particular, two or more layers can be bonded with intermediate fluoropolymer layers, such as intermediate coatings of fluoropolymer or a melt adhesive fluoropolymer. In another example, the layers can be pre-sized with a fluoropolymer and heat laminated together. In a further example, an adhesive, such as a silane adhesive, can be applied to bond the layers together. In an additional example, fiber layers, such as fiberglass layers, can be autogenously bonded in the presence of charged gas.

In particular, the tensile strength and trapezoidal tear strength can be measured after creasing one time with a 10 lb roller applied parallel to a fold. The tensile strength of the material after creasing with the 10 lb roller is denoted as the crease tensile strength, and the trapezoidal tear strength after creasing is denoted the crease trapezoidal tear strength.

      In a further example, the sheet material

      Further, the sheet material

      <b>
       100
      </b>
      is resistant to wicking of grease and charring of grease. In an example, wicking is tested by subjecting the sheet to hot grease for greater than 16 hours, typically 1 week, at 400° F. When grease wicks into the fabric or cooking sheet, it tends to char and weaken the fabric. In addition, it tends to discolor both the fabric and the individual filaments. Embodiments of the sheet material
      <b>
       100
      </b>
      described above exhibit little or no wicking, little or no charring of grease, and little or no discoloration of the filaments or the fabric. Thus, embodiments of the sheet material

      The sheet material can be formed by applying layers directly to the dispensed fabric or by laminating film to the fabric, or by combinations thereof. For example, an expanded PTFE film can be laminated to a side of the fabric. A film formed by skiving or by casting can be applied over the expanded PTFE film and laminated to the expanded PTFE film. Alternatively, a layer can be cast or dip coated directly to the expanded PTFE film, either after applying the expanded PTFE film to the fabric or prior to applying the expanded PTFE film to the fabric.
     </p>
     <p id="p-0062" num="0061">
      In particular, the method can include dispensing a reinforcement material, such as a fabric and applying an expanded PTFE film over one side of the reinforcement material. A cast PTFE film or a skived PTFE film can be laminated over the expanded PTFE film. Optionally, the process is performed on a single side of the reinforcement material. Alternatively, the process can be repeated or performed simultaneously for a second side of the reinforcement material.

     <p id="p-0063" num="0062">
      In another embodiment, the sheet material can be formed by a method that includes dispensing a fabric. In an example, the fabric is a fiberglass fabric that includes filaments that are individually size coated. The fabric can be dip coated into a dispersion including a fluoropolymer, such as a perfluoropolymer. Excess dispersion can be metered from the fabric and the fluoropolymer dispersion can be heated to drive off solvents and surfactants and to consolidate the fluoropolymer. The coating process can be performed one or more times, such as at least two times, at least three times, or even at least four times. A fluoropolymer film can be laminated to the coated fabric or a layer can be extruded or cast onto one or more surfaces of the coated fabric.

     <p id="p-0064" num="0063">
      In a particular example, the sheet material is formed through a process of coating a carrier web or a reinforcement material (e.g., the fabric) with a low surface energy, low coefficient of friction material, such as fluoropolymer. The carrier web or the reinforcement material are paid from a roll and coated on at least one side with a suspension including fluorinated polymer particles dispersed in a liquid medium. In one particular embodiment, the suspension includes a fluoropolymer aqueous dispersion to which surfactant has been added. Alternatively, the suspension can be free of surfactant.
     </p>
     <p id="p-0065" num="0064">
      A blade or metering rod is positioned to remove excess suspension from the carrier web. The suspension is then dried and sintered to form a layer on the carrier web. In a particular embodiment, the coated suspension is dried at a temperature in a range of about 150° F. to about 300° F. and sintered at a temperature in a range of about 550° F. to about 720° F. Optionally, surfactants can be driven off the coating prior to sintering by heating at a temperature in a range of about 500° F. to about 600° F. The thickness of the layer can be increased by repeating the coating process. In one exemplary embodiment, the carrier web can be coated with the suspension, the suspension dried, and a second coating applied to the dried suspension before sintering.

      In exemplary embodiments, the thickness of the fluorinated polymer coating is generally about 0.2-12 mils. For example, the thickness can be about 0.2-4 mils, such as about 0.5-3 mils. The second layer can have a thickness of about 0.1 mils to about 5 mils, such as about 0.1 mils to 3 mils, or even about 0.1 mils to 1 mil.
     </p>
     <p id="p-0067" num="0066">
      A second layer of fluoropolymer can be applied over the first layer. For example, the second layer can include a second fluoropolymer. Alternatively, the second layer can be applied by extruding a layer over the first layer. In another example, a second layer can be laminated to first layer, such as through heat lamination.
     </p>
     <p id="p-0068" num="0067">
      A third layer of fluoropolymer can be applied over the second layer. For example, the third layer can include a third fluoropolymer. The third layer can be applied by extruding or casting over the second layer. In an example, the third layer can be extruded or cast over the second layer prior to laminating the second layer to the first layer. In another example, a third layer can be laminated to second layer, such as through heat lamination. For example, the third layer can be a skived layer that is laminated to the second layer. The third layer can be laminated to the second layer either prior to, after, or substantially at the same time as laminating the second layer to the first layer.

      In a further embodiment, a cooking film can be formed using the above described method by replacing the reinforcement layer with a carrier or an extruded film. The coated film is formed on the carrier or the extruded film. In the case of coating on a carrier, the coated film is subsequently separated from the carrier to provide a free form coated film. The free form coated film can be laminated to a reinforcement material or an extruded film. In an example, the free form coated film can be laminated to an extruded film and the combination laminated to a reinforcement material. In another example, an extruded film coated with a coated film can be laminated to the reinforcement material. In a further example, an extruded film and a free form coated film can be laminated to a reinforcement material separately. A cooking belt can be formed using the above described method followed by coupling ends of the sheet material to form a closed loop belt in which the outer surface of the belt has nucleation structures. In another embodiment, the cooking sheet can be applied as a cover on a conveyor belt or a liner of a cooking container. In an additional example, cooking surface with nucleation structures can be applied by spray coating the layer.
     </p>
     <p id="p-0070" num="0069">
      In particular, the sheet material, the cooking film, or the conveyor belt is formed of materials and structures suitable for use in cooking applications, and are not formed of materials that are not accepted for at least cooking applications by the United States Food of America and Drug Administration. In an example, the conveyor belt or film can be used in commercial cooking services. For example, the conveyor belt or film can be used in meat cooking processes, such as to cook bacon, chicken, mixed meat products, or any combination thereof. In another example, a film can be placed into a vessel used to boil water. In general, the sheet material, cooking sheet, or film can be used to form a non-stick cooking surface with low splatter characteristics.
     </p>
     <p id="p-0071" num="0070">
      Particular embodiments of the sheet material exhibit desirable technical advantages. For example, the sheet material exhibits a resistance to split formation and propagation. In particular, the cooking belts have an extended durability and resistance to tear. Further, the coated belts can be resistant to creasing, wicking of grease, and charring. As described below, testing has shown durability under strenuous conditions with desirable cooking performance. As such, the cooking belts provide a durable film that maintains food quality.
